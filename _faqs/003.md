q: How is LogZilla Licensed?
a: LogZilla is licensed based on the amount of Events Per Day that you send to the server. Our <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=9489135.PN.&OS=PN/9489135&RS=PN/9489135" target="_new">patented</a> data clustering feature is an algorithm which condenses billions of entries into a narrow set, but still tracks every event down to the millisecond. In doing so, we are able to save up to 95% of the disk space needed to store your data.
