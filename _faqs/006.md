q: Does LogZilla offer product training?
a: LogZilla does not offer a traditional "training" course. This is simply due to the software's ease of use. We firmly believe that our customers should be provided with a product that allows them to learn and use in a matter of minutes. Please be sure to check the help section in the LogZilla UI, then contact us for any additional questions. You will find that our support staff is very responsive!
