q: Which database do you use?
a: When we created LogZilla, we found that no databases were capable of handling the scale we were seeking. Because of this, we wrote our own <a href="http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2=HITOFF&d=PALL&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r=1&f=G&l=50&s1=9489135.PN.&OS=PN/9489135&RS=PN/9489135" target="_new">patented storage mechanism</a>. As a result, LogZilla is easily 10x faster than any other product on the market. LogZilla's engine is capable of ingesting and indexing over 80k Events/Second on a single server, compared to other solutions at 7-10k EPS!
