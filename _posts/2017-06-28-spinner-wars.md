# Booth update and Spinner wars
Day two at CiscoLive! was so much better than expected.  We had a lot of return visitors and everyone is spending more time with us today. I am chalking that up to the super fun Logizallians covering the booth and not the fidget spinners we are giving away. Intersting thing about cool booth swag; it brings in other vendors who are interested in what we do, so being able to network (pun intended), has been priceless. Talking with so many people that do NetOps daily has given me a new perspective on how important LogZilla is in this space. It blows my mind how many people are logging data but cant or dont use it, but want to. I wish there was a way to share some of the reactions I got today after demo'ing our platform. I had a similar reaction this morning after I saw a competitor talk to a customer while playing with a LogZilla spinner. 

CiscoLive! is an awesome place because adults are aplauded when they let their inner child out, even just a little bit. Like all children, CiscoLive! attendees and vendors will become competitive somehwere around day two. Just outside our booth, we were playing with some of the other kids and this is what happened:

If you are at CiscoLive! this week, stop by the Solutions Showcase next to the Beer Garden and say hello and try to talk me out of a spinner! Trades are good post on social media just might let you release your inner child!


LogZilla is built by NetOps, for NetOps.
