# Fidget spinners and Hooker Marketing
Day one at CiscoLive! was amazing.  There were so many people standing at the gates ready to get in the show before it opened.  It reminded me a lot of the pictures of Wal-Mart on Black Friday, just at a much larger scale and with happier people.  LogZilla has a booth in the Solutions Showcase and as fate may have it, right beside the Beer Garden.  We are getting a lot of good traffic, so location, location, location!

There are about twenty other vendors in the Showcase in our area and I am happy to say that we are consistently more busy than any of them.  There are three of us LogZoids working the show and we are actively recruiting attendees to come meet the team and get a demo of the software.  I bet we did close to a hundred demos yesterday and met some really great folks.

We decided to offer a fidget spinner as a booth gift to help get us noticed. **BEST BOOTH GIFT EVER.**  People are nuts for these things. I had never seen a spinner before yesterday but I am hooked.  Spinning that gadget has the same addictive reaction as a smoker had with nicotine. Seriously, you cant put this thing down. Here is what we are giving away:

We printed a bunch of small cards to advertise said spinners and walked around handing them out.  Clayton took a few and left in the restroom by the hand towels and surprisingly it brought bodies to our booth (YEA! Marketing LogZoids!).  One of the attendees was kind enough to tweet about said cards in the restrooms to let us know this is how hookers market their services.  Well, we would not know about that but it made us all laugh and I guess it is a pretty good indication that we are getting noticed.

After I post this, I am pretty sure all the other vendors will try hooker marketing, but we did it first and the real happy ending comes from the increased visibility you will get into your network!

If you are at CiscoLive! this week stop by the Solutions Showcase next to the Beer Garden and say hello.  We don't have a lot of spinners left so expect us to get a little creative on how we give these things away.
