# PUT ON THE DINOSUR SUIT

Day 3 at CiscoLive! started out with a LogZillian gearing up in a dinosaur costume and giving free spinner cards out to the guest waiting to get inside the show.  If you have never put on a 8 foot tall costume and wandered among the regular folks, I would recommend it.

You know a funny thing happens when people realize that you are not there to destroy their city and smash their cars, they want to get a picture with you.  I was able to give out a hundred cards in just a few minutes then all I had to do was walk around.  I really wish Cisco did not have music playing in the open areas, you know a LogZillian in a dinosaur suite is going to dance.  Not one of my finest moments but it is off my bucket list now.  So Cisco had a game where you could race someone else by running in place on a platform. Why do all trade show people want to pick on dinosaurs? Yep, it was on and you will be happy to know that LogZilla kicked butt.  Of course I almost hyperventilated and the suite got really hot but we got visibility.

The booth traffic was a little slower but there was a steady stream of visitors looking for spinners and we took every opportunity to demo how awesome our platform is. There was a lot of interest from utility, education and transportation sectors today. They either had data and were not using it or were using something that they could not get information out of easily.  The feedback we have gotten this week has really reinforced the value we provide and the fact that people will stop by for a gift and stick around for an hour just to find out a little bit more. It is a a real testament to the need for us in this market space. **Being at CiscoLive! has been a super positive experience for the team here and I think we have made an impact on a lot of possible customers, partners and other vendors.**

So CiscoLive! sponsored an up and coming artist, you might have heard of him, his name is Bruno Mars.  Yeah, BRUNO FREAKING MARS preformed last night at T-Mobile arena.  We had a blast and got to see how a bunch of network super heroes let loose after work. Having free food and beer was pretty cool as well, but we don't know much about that. One take away I have is what an amazing job Cisco has done managing all of this. Kudos and THANK YOU!

If you are at CiscoLive! this week, stop by the Solutions Showcase next to the Beer Garden and ask to speak to the guy that was wearing the dinosur suite.  I will give you a free spineer!
