 Within minutes after installing and pointing your network and server events to the LogZilla server, you will have visibility into what is really going on in your environment. 

 Have you ever considered what your job would be like if you could look at one interface to see the data from your entire infrastructure? **In real-time**? 

 What about querying across all that data...in seconds? 

 How about immediate remediation when an event indicates there is a problem? All of this is available today and the new dashboards make it easier than ever to empower teams, automate, and move from reactive to proactive.  

You can use these out of the box dashboards, customize them, or even build your own in minutes.  All of the dashboards are powerful, and if you work in any type of engineering or operations capacity, you will not find a easier to use platform to solve your NetOps problems and provide the broad, real-time visibility of LogZilla.

**These New Dashboards Include**:

*   Cisco Networking
*   Cisco Most Actionable 
*   Cisco Security
