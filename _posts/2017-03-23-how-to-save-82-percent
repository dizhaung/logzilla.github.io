# How to Save 82% on Centralized Log Management Deployment costs

### By: Richard Piotrowski on March 23, 2017

LogZilla's market defining and patented software allows companies to save up to 90% on deployment and maintenance costs over competitive solutions, while getting the fastest unstructured data management platform in the world.

Cisco Systems® published a reference design for a Splunk implementation to index “up to 2 TB/day”.  This reference design requires 14 UCS servers and will cost $482,000USD in server and networking hardware.

That architecture translates to about 50k Events Per Second (EPS) spread out over 14 servers. That comes to about ~3500 EPS per server.  The cost of software licensing, professional services, training, support, and any add-ons are extra.

LogZilla easily indexes the same amount of data on a single server. 

PIC 2: Deduplication

You just saved your company $482,000USD

...and you haven't even received their quote for the software, licensing, and other "hidden" costs such as professional service, support, training & any add-on packages

LogZilla replaces several full racks of equipment recommended by competitors.

Considering the cost of an Enterprise-class server that can handle these volumes, it’s easy to see how your savings on hardware costs alone can quickly contribute to LogZilla’s ROI.

## How much will storage cost?

Consider an environment logging 2TB/day of data, with a 30-day retention.

At the time this document was written, the average cost of enterprise-class storage is approximately $275 for 6TB of storage. Enterprise-class systems will also use RAID10 for redundancy, which means giving up half the storage capacity to raid. Thus, for 30 days of storage, it would take up 120TB (physical) for a competitive solution.

Using LogZilla's patented ERA algorithm, storage needs for your data is decreased from 120TB to 12TB (physical) to store that same data with no message loss.  Without LogZilla, your cost for disks alone comes to $5,500.

With LogZilla's ERA, storing the same amount of data takes a mere $550.

## How much will power usage cost?

What about the power needed to cool all the hardware? What's the cost of HVAC for those servers?

Note: ¢/kWh Cost based on http://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/pdf/epm.pdf

The picture of true deployment cost now becomes clear; not only are you saving considerable cost on monthly storage and compute resources, but you are saving even more on Rack Space and Cooling for these systems.

This representsa a saving of 82 percent over the major competition.  The bottom line is that LogZilla will save you money when comparing TCO, while providing the world’s best performance where all data is available in the server in real-time.
