 You know the saying "the customer is always right?" It turns out that it is true :)

I meet with a lot of our customers. In the past two weeks I have had multiple conversations where I asked, "what do you like about LogZilla?" Instead of "its fast or "it scales and saves us money", they have responded with "It provides real-time streaming of our logs." 

They will follow up with *"we can immediately filter across our entire infrastructure and drill into the offending host."* They like our widgets too. But, it takes hearing what the customer cares about to see the value. We have some amazing features that no one else has. Those features have given us the ability to do the real-time log streaming and provide visibility at a scale never seen before, but in the end, it is real-time log streaming across the entire infrastructure that matters.

It is a transformation for a company full of engineers and developers to realize that these are the things that are important to our customers. I have listened and am thankful to them for helping us to see what was right in front of our face.
