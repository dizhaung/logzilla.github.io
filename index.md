## WannaCry: Instantly Visibility

 If you are in the free speaking world and have access to news outlets, you've no doubt heard about the WannaCry ransomware attack targeting systems all over the world.  The estimates are that over a quarter of a million computers have been compromised spanning more than 150 countries.  If you have anything to do with the operations and engineering of your company's infrastructure, you probably started wondering if WannaCry had made itâ€™s way into your piece of the universe. 

 An easy way to get visibility into the WannaCry malware in your environment is to install LogZilla and use the pre-built rules from our [LogZilla Extras GitHub](http://bit.ly/2qumD4C) repository.
 
 Next, point your network and server telemetry to your LogZilla server and, wWithin seconds, you'll be able to select `IoC-WannaCry` or `IoC-IP_Blacklist` from the Program dropdown to see if your company has been infected.
